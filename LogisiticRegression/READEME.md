# Logistic Regression on Insurance Data

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of **Logistic Regression** using Python to predict whether a person is likely to buy insurance based on their age.  

It provides a simple example of applying supervised machine learning for a binary classification problem.

## ⚙️ Steps Covered
1. **Data Loading**: Importing insurance dataset (`age`, `bought_insurance`).  
2. **Data Visualization**: Scatter plot of age vs insurance purchase decision.  
3. **Train/Test Split**: Splitting the dataset for training and evaluation.  
4. **Model Training**: Applying `LogisticRegression` from `scikit-learn`.  
5. **Model Evaluation**: Checking predictions, probabilities, and accuracy score.  
6. **Custom Prediction Function**: Implementing a `sigmoid` function to estimate probability of insurance purchase for a given age.

## 📊 Results
- Model Accuracy: **88%**  
- Example Predictions:
  - Age 35 → 65% chance of buying insurance.  
  - Age 43 → 96% chance.  
  - Age 52 → 99% chance.
