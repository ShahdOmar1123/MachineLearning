Task 1: Student Score Prediction

Dataset (Recommended): Student Performance Factors (Kaggle)

Build a model to predict students' exam scores based on their study hours

Perform data cleaning and basic visualization to understand the dataset

Split the dataset into training and testing sets

Train a linear regression model to estimate final scores

Visualize predictions and evaluate model performance

Evaluation metrics

Try polynomial regression and compare performance

Try experimenting with different feature combinations (e.g., removing or adding features like sleep, participation, etc.)
